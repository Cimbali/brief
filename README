Digest

Digest is a lightweight RSS reader extension for Firefox.
It is a fork of Brief by Adam Kowalczyk (brief.mozdev.org,
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/brief/).
The aim of this fork is to make the addon compatible with Firefox 21+
and possibly make future improvements.

Digest is released under MPL 2.0, which is an upgrade from
Brief's MPL 1.1.

Version 1.0 has been released on 2013-05-14
 - Support Firefox 21-23

Issues and pull requests are welcome.
